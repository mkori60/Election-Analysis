## Election Audit Summary 

This code can easily be repurposed for use in auditing other elections. 
Firstly, the source of the voting information will have to be changed in the lines of code shown below:

Secondly, if the voting data is in a different format, the columns will have to be changed in order to align with the information that is being referenced. In the picture below, the [1] and [2] may neeed to be changed if the data is not in an identical order to the data that was used for this election audit.
